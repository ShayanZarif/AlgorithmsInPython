# AlgorithmsInPython
"""
In this repository I put most of my files which are for my revision before any 
coding competitions.I documented my code so that I do not have watch any 
more tutorials learning them again.
I created this repository for not overpopulating my PC with python files.
All the algorithms in this repository are written in python because it feels 
like reading Engilsh.
